        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Zero-Emission Electric Vehicles (ZEVs) have soared in popularity in the last decade. As technology and innovation drove through leaps and bounds, nations worldwide have started to transition from a century of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) to clean, sophisticated, and silent vehicles. America and abroad have transitioned to electrification producing ZEVs—and the market has skyrocketed.</p>

        <p>According to The International Council on Clean Transportation, the market was "valued at USD 171.26 Billion in 2020, and is expected to reach a value of USD 725.14 Billion by 2026…". Simply put, the market has grown from a few thousand vehicles in 2010 to more than 315,000 vehicles sold annually from 2018 to 2020. According to Yahoo Finance, a key player here is Tesla. As of February 25, 2021, their market capitalization was USD 827.6 Billion, effectively making it the world's largest ZEV and car manufacturer (by market capitalization).</p>

        <p>The rapid growth and expansion of electric car sales have led to questions about the proposition of electric cars paired with President Biden signing an Executive Order "tackling climate change…and advancing environmental justice" in a statement release of setting an "ambitious new target to make half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 zero-emissions vehicles," according to the White House government site.</p>

        <p>Policymakers around the globe have also done their job to push ZEVs with numerous subsidies, zero-emission credits, mandates, and tax breaks. What is the basis of major world powers wanting to shift the economy and market to ZEVs drastically? Are they that beneficial? Compared to conventional ICEVs, ZEVs were designed to be better in energy efficiency, performance, convenience, and maintenance. Without them emitting any emissions, they're supposed to be greener too. With increasing fuel costs and government incentives, it would seem almost wrong not to change to a ZEV, right?</p>

        <p><strong>What if I were to tell you that, despite what you may have heard, ZEVs might not be all that innocent and clean. Depending on their power source, they could be worse.</strong> Yes, I said that right. That BMW 3 series your son wants might not be all that worse compared to the new Tesla Model 3, you would rather have.</p>

        <h2>Environmental Concerns</h2>
        <p><strong>How could electric cars have any environmental problems?</strong> I thought that ZEVs do not produce any harmful gasses from the vehicle? Yes, that's true; the vehicle itself doesn't produce anything, but where does the energy that powers your car come from? Energy doesn't appear out of thin air. Your nation's electrical grid charges an electric vehicle. Most of our power is generated by burning coal, fossil fuels, and natural gases.</p>

        <p>A study done in 2014 published in the Journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science examined ZEV's emissions from the start of the mining of the metals needed to generate the electricity required to power them. Tessum and his team found that using coal-generated electricity, electric cars are worse for the environment than conventional gasoline cars. Colin J. R. Sheppard, a researcher with expertise in energy and transportation systems engineering at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, concluded, "Only when connected to the dirtiest, coal-heavy electric grids do gasoline internal combustion engines become comparable to E.V.s on a greenhouse gas basis." in his 2021 publication Private versus Shared, Automated Electric Vehicles for U.S. Personal Mobility: Energy Use, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Grid Integration, and Cost Impacts.</p>

        <p>A separate peer-reviewed study by scientists of Carnegie Mellon Vehicle Electrification Group in 2016 examined pollutants of E.V.s in the PJM Interconnection, a large and coal-heavy regional electricity transmission organization. In the report, Weis's team found that relying on coal, electric vehicles created 2-3 times the emission costs of a gasoline vehicle, largely due to SO2 from coal. What does this mean in layman's terms? If we continue to use coal as our primary source of generating electricity, it will produce more emissions than a gas vehicle. </em>.</p>

        <p>Well, that seems wrong, right? How could your neighbor's 1960 HEMI Challenger, which gets 7 MPG at best, be better than a new, sleek, spaceship-like electric vehicle? Well, it's not. The comparison is with only using coal-heavy electric grids. If we only used these energy sources like these, electric cars wouldn't be implemented widespread.</p>

        <p>Well, they are only a couple of places where coal powers more than half of their electric grids. One place is China, where a study done by China's plan to cut coal and boost green growth. In 2019, about 58% of the country's power supply came from coal.</p>

        <p>Thankfully, as time progressed, the industry has been retiring coal and fossil fuels, transitioning to renewable energies, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. This is an improvement- and "is a global one, and it helps to boost the environmental credentials of electric vehicles," said Gordon Bauer, an electric vehicle researcher at the International Council on Clean Transportation in San Francisco. "As grids become greener during the lifetime of an electric vehicle, it's only going to get better."</p>

        <p>The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects renewable shares of U.S. electricity (such as hydro, wind, solar, and other renewables) will double from 21% in 2020 to 42% in 2050 (the additional 58% being natural gas, coal, and nuclear power). Still a long time away, but it's good we're moving in the right direction. Changing the infrastructure of our nation's electric grid to more renewable energies will be one step forward of many to make Electric vehicles truly beneficial for our environment. </p>

        <p>Those saying the EIAs projections are superfluous are not entirely wrong. Sheppard does admit they are "ambitious," imagining a country of mostly renewable energy yet still not achieving the goal of zero-carbon or a national grid not contributing to climate change. Yet there still is hope; a momentous amount of active revisions and political will is needed to make ZEVs what they could be. </p>

        <h2>Batteries</h2>
        <p>Another reason ZEVs are not that beneficial for the environment and you is due to the lithium-ion batteries in the car. Manufacturing them requires many rare earth elements and emits colossal amounts of carbon dioxide. Due to the added weight of the battery, the vehicle causes even more damage to the road infrastructure. Another problem with these types of batteries is that they are not recyclable, as only 5% of the world's Lithium-Ion batteries are being recycled, according to Chemical and Engineering News. So, where do the rest of the 95% go? Andrew Sheldon, in AAA Northeast, stated that it goes to landfills, "where their hazardous components can leak into the soil and groundwater. Landfills are also a major contributor of greenhouse gas emissions, the EPA reports." Well, can they be recycled? Short answer, nope, it's hard work, costs too much, and is too complicated, effectively making it not feasible. </p>
        
        <p>Lithium-Ion batteries also become less effective as they age, decreasing the cells' effectiveness in the battery pack. Have you ever gotten annoyed that your phone dies sooner with more use and as it ages, making you need to charge it more? That's all thanks to battery degradation. The problem with that on a more massive scale is the lower capacity of batteries means less range. Having an already not so amazing median range of 250 miles according to the office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, having a decreased incapacity is not practical nor efficient. </p>
        
        <p>If you look past the range, what about the battery's longevity? Racheal Nearler, Deputy Director for Transportation Technology and policy at White House Council on Environmental Quality, states that the batteries come with a warranty of 100,000 miles and do not need replacing, as one battery is sufficient for the car's lifetime. So there is a guarantee that these cars will at least last 100,000 miles. But what about if you would want to use it more? What would happen then? Well, many problems occur after the 100,000-mile mark. Professor Samveg Saxena, in his research paper titled "Quantifying E.V. Battery End-of-life Through Analysis of Travel Needs with Vehicle Powertrain Models," an educator at the Indian Institute of Technology for engineering, states, "regardless of climate, over time the effectiveness and range of the battery decrease during use. Such reductions would result in a loss of range in original battery capacity." So you might be saving that gas money in the beginning, but later on, it may end up drilling a hole in your wallet due to them costing up to $20,000, according to Jon Witt, a battery scientist at Recurrent, in his research paper "Costs of Electric Car Battery Replacement."</p>

        <h2>Repairability</h2>

        <p>According to Louis Rossmann, an independent repair technician and an avid right-to-repair activist, many ZEVs, Teslas, in particular, are locked against maintenance and cannot be repaired unless it is a certified technician. This causes a problem for those who want to learn how to maintain their cars to make them reliable and usable for the foreseeable future of the car's lifespan. The issues that will develop over time won't be repaired by owners who have the expertise and equipment to repair; this is a problem with the current state of electric cars.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>While electric cars have been promoted as perfect, amazing vehicles, there are huge hidden costs on ZEV emissions and the battery. I am not claiming that electric cars are bad for the environment, but they are not what they could be with the proper implementation of technology and planning. </p>

        <p>One flux of transitioning to ZEVs would cause an increase in energy consumption within our electrical grid, correlating to increased energy costs. The more expensive it is to charge your car, the fewer people would transition. To solve that, Sheppard calculated if ZEV owners would indulge in "controlled charging" (or known as "smart charging"). It's a technique where you’d charge your electric vehicle at tactical intervals to reduce the cost of producing electricity. (i.e., charging at night is generally cheaper than charging in the day by favoring efficient energy plants which generate more affordable electricity.)</p>

        <p>Ways to combat this would be transitioning to more renewable energy sources and, if possible, indulging ZEV owners in installing solar panels in their homes to use more clean energy to power their homes and cars.</p>

        <p>Another thing that Governments can do is to diversify the implementation by assisting the aid ( by tax breaks, subsidies, credits, etc.) of other vehicles, such as hybrid electric cars. Many manufacturers should also stop the false marketing of electric vehicles being super "green." In the future, relying on different technologies of batteries combating their horrendous environmental impacts, and using the U.S. to allow a mixture between these calls to action, can achieve their ambitious goal of shifting completely to electric vehicles. </p>
